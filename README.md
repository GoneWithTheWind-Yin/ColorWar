Description: 

Normal Tower Defense Game:
This is a tower defense game. A kind of strategy game where the goal is to defend the player's base by stopping enemies from reaching the base, achieved by building defense towers near the path of enemies. The player should decide their defense strategy according to the enemy type and build their defense power. In the meanwhile, they should focus on the economy, which will limit them in building towers.

Our ideas:
Instead of destroying the enemy, the defense tower can randomly change the enemy's color by shooting it. The Base won’t lose HP if the enemy has the same color as it. Players can lock the enemy’s color by clicking the enemy.


Player’s Goal: 
Build defense towers to shoot the enemy and change its color
Lock the enemy’s color once it is the same as the Base’s color
Protect the Base from HP reducing to 0

Prototype Design
Map
The map of this game consists of grids and a route. The route is for enemies to move, and the grid is the place where players can put towers to attack enemies. Enemies will be generated at the start point of the route, and the Base is at the end point of the route. 

Enemy
The enemy moves along the route with a certain speed. The color of the enemy will change according to the color of the defense tower shells. Players can click on the enemy to lock it. Once locked, the color of the enemy will not change and will not be attacked by ordinary defense towers.

Tower
In the game, players can build defensive towers on squares other than roads. Each defensive tower has its own attack range. When the enemy enters the attack range of the defensive tower, it will start to attack. The defensive tower will attack the enemy in the order in which they enter the defensive tower. If the enemy is locked, the defensive tower will not attack the enemy. Otherwise, the defensive tower will not change the attack target. There are different types of defense towers, and the effects of bullets are also different.

Bullet
Bullets are launched from defensive towers in the game and have the ability to track the enemy. When they collide with the enemy, they can change enemies' color and have some other effects.

Base
The Base is a territory of the player, which has limited health. It can be destroyed by enemies that have different color of base. The player’s first goal is to protect his base from being touched by enemies. If the base HP is less than or equal to zero, the game will fail.

Money
At the beginning of the game, players will get a certain amount of initial money, which can be used to build and upgrade defensive towers on the map. The enemy with the same color as the base arrives at the base, a certain amount of money can also be obtained. Players need to spend different amounts of money to build or upgrade different types of defense towers. The game requires a certain strategy, and players must use money reasonably to win the game.

Difficulty
The entire game has different levels. As the difficulty levels increase, the route of the map will change, and the types and number of enemies will increase. Also, in the same level, it has several waves of enemies. The later waves will contain more  enemies with faster speed Hence, the player should build more towers as the game goes on.
